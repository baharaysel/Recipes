		<h2>Sweetcorn & spinach fritters</h2>
		<img src="images/sweetcorn-spinach-fritters.jpg" alt="The photo of Sweetcorn & spinach fritters" width="300">
		<p>
			These healthy sweetcorn and spinach fritters are packed with vitamin C from the veg, plus protein from the egg.<br> They make great finger foods for baby-led weaning.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 x small 195g can no-salt sweetcorn, drained</li>
			<li>small handful baby spinach leaf</li>
			<li>1 small garlic clove, crushed</li>
			<li>1 spring onion, chopped</li>
			<li>50g plain flour</li>
			<li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
			<li>1 egg</li>
			<li>50ml milk</li>
			<li>1 tsp rapeseed oil, for frying</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Method</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Pulse all the ingredients except the oil in a food processor until fairly but not completely smooth.
			</li>
				Heat a little oil in a frying pan until hot and dollop four spoonfuls of the mixture into the pan leaving space around them. Fry for just under 1 min on each side until lightly golden. When you flip the fritter, flatten with a spatula to ensure even cooking the whole way through. Cook in three batches, placing the cooked fritters on a plate covered with kitchen roll. Serve warm.
			<li>
				You can freeze any fritters you don’t need. Lay them on a baking sheet, then once frozen, transfer to a freezer bag. Reheat the frozen fritters in the oven (180C/160fan/gas 4) for around 10 mins until piping hot. Allow to cool to lukewarm before serving.

		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
			<li>1 onion, chopped</li>
			<li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
			<li>2 carrots, peeled and diced
			<li>1 stick celery, diced</li>
			<li>1 yellow pepper, diced</li>
			<li>pinch of cumin</li>
			<li>250g lean lamb mince (10% fat)</li>
			<li>1 courgette, diced</li>
			<li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
			<li>400ml low salt beef stock</li>

			<li>1.2kg Maris Piper potatoes</li>
			<li>50g butter</li>
			<li>75ml milk</li>
			<li>60g grated cheddar</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Method</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Heat the oil in a medium saucepan, add the onion and cook for around 5 mins until softened. Stir in the garlic, carrots, celery, pepper and cumin. Cook for a further two mins, then add the lamb. Brown the meat, tipping off any excess fat. Add the courgette and tomato purée, then fry for a few mins more. Pour in the stock, add the lentils and bring to a simmer. Cook for 40 mins, stirring from time to time.
			</li>
				Heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Boil the potatoes for 10-15 mins until tender. Drain, then mash with the butter and milk.
			<li>
				Remove the lamb mixture from the heat and use a stick blender to purée. Stir as you purée, blending down the pieces of vegetables. Spoon into 8 largish individual ramekins. Top with the mash and grated cheese. The pie can now be chilled and frozen for up to a month. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake for 30 mins until the top is golden and the mince is bubbling up at the sides. (Cook from frozen at 160C/fan 140C/gas 3 for about 40 mins, then turn up to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 for 20-30 mins or until golden on top and piping hot in the centre.) Leave to stand for at least 10 mins before serving. Check it has cooled down sufficiently in the centre before giving it to young children.
